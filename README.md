8. > Given an object containing counts of both upvotes and downvotes, return what vote count should be displayed. This is calculated by subtracting the number of downvotes from upvotes.

9. > The 50-30-20 strategy is a simple way to budget, which involves spending 50% of after-tax income on
   > needs, 30% after tax income on wants, and 20% after-tax income on savings or paying off debt.
   > Given the after-tax income as ati, what you are supposed to do is to make a function that will return an
   > object that shows how much a person needs to spend on needs, wants, and savings.
